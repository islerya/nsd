# Abstract of the paper
This study aims to assess the effect of Rapid Maxillary Expansion (RME) on Nasal Septal Deviation (NSD) changes from three-dimensional (3D) images. In this study, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images from 15 patients with maxillary constriction (mean age 12 ± 1.6 years) were included. RME treatment with Hyrax appliance was performed in all patients. CBCT scans were taken at three different times; before appliance insertion (T0), after active expansion (T1) and 3 months after appliance insertion (T2). We developed a novel Matlab-based application to quantify NSD based on the tortuosity ratio by dividing the actual length of the septum by the ideal length in the mid-sagittal plane by using this application. Turtuosity ratio (TR) values were found as 1.03 ± 0.03 (T0), 1.02 ± 0.02 (T1), and 1.02 ± 0.02 (T2). Differences of TR values among these groups were evaluated using the statistical method of ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) for repeated measures with the significance level of p ≤ .05. Results showed significant reductions in TR values between T0-T1 (p ≤ .05) and between T0-T2 (p ≤ .05). Nonetheless, a significant difference between T1–T2 was not determined (p > .05). As a result, we can conclude that the NSD degree is affected by the RME treatment. The developed application can be used for both educational and research purposes.
